        How about a Q&A game?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Year 2021 it was Provincialization Memorial of Province of Chaco, to celebrate, a group
      of 8 programmers and I developed from scratch a Q&A game to probe yourself how much 
      information do you know about the Province of Chaco in Argentina.

        How about a corner-stores managing app?

        <p>
        Looking for doing a contribution on little-shops growth and development, this app
        has stock, sales, employees modules along with statistics and reports. As a future 
        feature it will include statistics-based advices on how much buy or best times to stay
        open during day or night or even which customers are more profitable and which aren't 
        then you can focus in offers and upsells for them.

        Wandering around Fiveer some of my gigs were doing a little bit of webscraping, yes!
        someone asked me about retrieving all posible data about Retirement Home in England
          from a given website and then save them into a SpreadSheet.

        How about an Android app made with Python?
      </h3>
        <p>
        Tired of having to save a new contact every single time that a given Seller needs
          to contact a new prospect, that person came to me to ask for a method to start a
          new WhatsApp conversation without saving the contact on her phone. That's when NoSave
          Android App came to live. Using WhatsApps Api to start a new conversation based in the 
          number alone this apps gives free time with no need of save a new contact every time you
          need to make a call over WhatsApp. Cool.
