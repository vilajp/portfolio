        How about a Q&A game?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Year 2021 it was Provincialization Memorial of Province of Chaco, to celebrate, a group
      of 8 programmers and I developed from scratch a Q&A game to probe yourself how much 
      information do you know about the Province of Chaco in Argentina.

        How about a corner-stores managing app?
      </h3>
        <p>
        Looking for doing a contribution on little-shops growth and development, this app
        has stock, sales, employees modules along with statistics and reports. As a future 
        feature it will include statistics-based advices on how much buy or best times to stay
        open during day or night or even which customers are more profitable and which aren't 
        then you can focus in offers and upsells for them.
